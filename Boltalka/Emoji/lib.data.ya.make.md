```cmake
UNION()  
# The UNION() function is called, which typically combines or merges data or results from multiple sources.  
# In this context, it might be preparing to unify outputs from subsequent operations or files.

FROM_SANDBOX(FILE 1382765660 OUT model.pb)  
# The FROM_SANDBOX() function is used to retrieve a file from a sandbox environment.  
# FILE 1382765660 specifies the unique identifier of the file to be retrieved.  
# OUT model.pb indicates that the retrieved file will be saved or referenced as "model.pb".  
# "model.pb" is likely a serialized model file, possibly in Protocol Buffers format.

FROM_SANDBOX(FILE 1382760267 OUT model)  
# Another FROM_SANDBOX() function call is made to retrieve a second file from the sandbox environment.  
# FILE 1382760267 specifies the unique identifier of the second file to be retrieved.  
# OUT model indicates that this file will be saved or referenced as "model".  
# This file might represent a different version or format of the model.

END()  
# The END() function is called, signaling the conclusion of the current operation or script.  
# This might finalize the process, ensuring all resources are properly closed or saved.
