```cmake
PY3_PROGRAM()  
# The PY3_PROGRAM() function declares that this is a Python 3 program.  
# This indicates that the project is intended to be executed as a standalone Python 3 application.

OWNER(  
# The OWNER() block specifies the owners or maintainers of this program.  
# These are typically individuals or groups responsible for the code.  
	nzinov  
	# "nzinov" is listed as one of the owners of this program.  
	g:alice_boltalka  
	# "g:alice_boltalka" is a group (likely a team or organization) also listed as an owner.  
)

PY_SRCS(main.py)  
# The PY_SRCS() function specifies the Python source files included in this program.  
# In this case, "main.py" is the primary source file for the program.

PY_MAIN(alice.boltalka.emoji.main)  
# The PY_MAIN() function specifies the entry point of the program.  
# The entry point is the module and function that will be executed when the program runs.  
# Here, the entry point is `alice.boltalka.emoji.main`, which is likely a function in the `main.py` file.

PEERDIR(  
# The PEERDIR() function lists directories or libraries that this program depends on.  
# These are peer dependencies required for the program to function correctly.  
	alice/boltalka/emoji/lib  
	# This points to a library or module related to emoji functionality within the `alice.boltalka.emoji` package.  
)

END()  
# The END() function signals the end of the current block or configuration.  
# This ensures that the program definition is properly closed.

RECURSE(  
# The RECURSE() function is used to include additional directories or subprojects recursively.  
# This allows the build system to process all files in the specified directories.  
	applier  
	# The "applier" directory is included recursively, meaning all files and subdirectories within it will be processed.  
	lib  
	# The "lib" directory is included recursively, meaning all files and subdirectories within it will be processed.  
)
