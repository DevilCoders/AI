```cmake
PY3_LIBRARY()  
# The PY3_LIBRARY() function declares that this is a Python 3 library.  
# This indicates that the code or project is intended to be used as a library in a Python 3 environment.

OWNER(  
# The OWNER() block specifies the owners or maintainers of this library.  
# These are typically individuals or groups responsible for the code.  
	nzinov  
	# "nzinov" is listed as one of the owners of this library.  
	g:alice_boltalka  
	# "g:alice_boltalka" is a group (likely a team or organization) also listed as an owner.  
)

PY_SRCS(main.py)  
# The PY_SRCS() function specifies the Python source files included in this library.  
# In this case, "main.py" is the primary source file for the library.

PEERDIR(  
# The PEERDIR() function lists directories or libraries that this project depends on.  
# These are peer dependencies required for the library to function correctly.  
	alice/boltalka/py_libs/apply_nlg_dssm  
	# This points to a library or module related to applying NLG (Natural Language Generation) and DSSM (Deep Structured Semantic Model).  
	alice/boltalka/extsearch/query_basesearch/lib  
	# This points to a library or module related to query base search functionality.  
	contrib/libs/tf/python  
	# This points to a TensorFlow Python library, likely used for machine learning or deep learning tasks.  
	contrib/python/numpy  
	# This points to the NumPy library, which is used for numerical computations in Python.  
)

END()  
# The END() function signals the end of the current block or configuration.  
# This ensures that the library definition is properly closed.

RECURSE(  
# The RECURSE() function is used to include additional directories or subprojects recursively.  
# This allows the build system to process all files in the specified directories.  
	data  
	# The "data" directory is included recursively, meaning all files and subdirectories within it will be processed.  
)
