```python
from alice.boltalka.emoji.lib.main import BoltalkaEmojifier  
# Imports the `BoltalkaEmojifier` class from the `main` module located in the `alice.boltalka.emoji.lib` package.  
# This class is used to predict emojis for text contexts and replies, and to retrieve replies with predicted emojis.

def main():  
    # Defines the `main` function, which serves as the entry point of the program.  
    # This function will be executed when the script is run.

    print(BoltalkaEmojifier(data_dir='lib/').get_replies_with_emoji(['привет', 'как дела?', 'нормально']))  
    # Creates an instance of the `BoltalkaEmojifier` class, specifying the `data_dir` as 'lib/'.  
    # This directory likely contains the necessary data files (e.g., models) for the emojifier.  
    # Calls the `get_replies_with_emoji` method on the instance, passing a list of text contexts:  
    # - 'привет' (Russian for "hello")  
    # - 'как дела?' (Russian for "how are you?")  
    # - 'нормально' (Russian for "fine" or "okay")  
    # The `get_replies_with_emoji` method retrieves candidate replies for each context and predicts emojis for them.  
    # The results are printed to the console.
