```cmake
OWNER(g:alice)  
# The OWNER() function specifies the owner or maintainer of the project.  
# In this case, the owner is the group `g:alice`, which is likely a team or organization responsible for the project.

RECURSE(  
# The RECURSE() function is used to include additional directories or subprojects recursively.  
# This allows the build system to process all files in the specified directories.

    bin  
    # Includes the `bin` directory recursively.  
    # This directory likely contains executable scripts or binaries for the project.

    lib  
    # Includes the `lib` directory recursively.  
    # This directory likely contains shared libraries or utility code for the project.
)
