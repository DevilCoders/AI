```cmake
PY3_LIBRARY()
# Specifies that this is a Python 3 library. This macro is used to define a Python library target compatible with Python 3.

OWNER(
    ran1s
    g:alice
)
# Specifies the owners of the library. This is typically used for ownership and access control in a collaborative environment.
# - `ran1s`: An individual owner (likely a username).
# - `g:alice`: A group owner (likely a team or organization).

PEERDIR(
    search/tunneller/libs/protocol_decl
)
# Lists the dependencies of the library using the `PEERDIR` macro. These are other libraries or modules that this library depends on.
# - `search/tunneller/libs/protocol_decl`: A dependency on the `protocol_decl` module, which likely contains protocol definitions.

PY_SRCS(
    checkers.py
    utils.py
)
# Lists the Python source files included in this library using the `PY_SRCS` macro.
# - `checkers.py`: Contains the implementation of checker classes (e.g., `MetaChecker`, `TunnellerChecker`).
# - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions (e.g., `collect_dump_data`, `generate_file_name`).

END()
# Marks the end of the library definition. This macro is used to close the scope of the library configuration.
