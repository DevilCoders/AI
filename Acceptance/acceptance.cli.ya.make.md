```cmake
OWNER(g:alice)  
# The OWNER() function specifies the owner or maintainer of the project.  
# In this case, the owner is the group `g:alice`, which is likely a team or organization responsible for the project.

RECURSE(  
# The RECURSE() function is used to include additional directories or subprojects recursively.  
# This allows the build system to process all files in the specified directories.

    dummy_downloader

    # This directory likely contains code or resources related to a dummy downloader component.

    marker_tests
